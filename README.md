### About The Ustukan
It seems that the traditions and customs of our ancestors, such as slaughtering sheep and offering meat, are being forgotten in recent times. It's no secret that we want to present ourselves as modern people as times change and eras change. It is clear that we ignore the sad sayings of great people, "Young people don't know anything, will they forget the true traditions of the Kyrgyz people like this?" Slaughtering a sheep when a guest comes is one of the good ceremonies left by our ancestors. Nowadays, if you have money, everything is ready, and if you are going to be a guest, you can go to the cattle market and bring back the cattle you bought there, butchered, butchered, and even gutted.
